The Game of Life which shows cells either dying or surviving in a universe based on population or its lacking.
First time using Swing to make a GUI, found it difficult due to the lack of materierial on Hyperskill for Swing.
Implementing this project could have gone better if I had split into an MVC model to make managing it easier.
Currently the slider bar works to increase the speed of the game. 
The other buttons are left non functioning.
I also need to improve my habit of leaving comments in my code.
